/**
 * App-side receiver + controller for the audio-capture handoff ("Resilient recording", Option B).

 * The recording engine calls [begin] with the output target BEFORE asking the daemon to start the
 * handoff. The daemon then pushes the `IAudioRecord` binder + cblk ashmem fd, which lands in [onReceived]
 * (routed by `RecorderBinderProvider`) on a binder thread. This object holds the binder — an independent
 * ref in the APP's binder_proc = keep-alive — and runs the full app-side capture: a native thread drains
 * the cblk ring to a pipe while [HandoffEncoder] reads the pipe and encodes into the engine's SAF output
 * fd. Killing the daemon mid-capture does NOT stop it: the track survives on the app's ref and the encode
 * is local. [stop] flips the stop flag and waits for the container to finalise.
