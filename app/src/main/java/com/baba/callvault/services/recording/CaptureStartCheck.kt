/**
 * Whether a capture the app asked for ever actually began.
 *
 * **Why this is needed.** `IRecorderService.startRecording` returns void and does its real work on a
 * worker afterwards, so a codec that will not configure throws *after* the call has returned. The
 * exception is caught inside the daemon — a process with no log file of its own — the output fd is
 * closed, and the app carries on believing a recording is running. The user gets no file, no error,
 * and nothing in the debug report they send.
 *
 * Issue #28's reporter hit this by switching the audio codec to AAC: "changing from Opus to AAC
 * failed to record the next call." We could not tell him why, because nothing anywhere recorded why.
 *
 * `isRecording()` has been in the AIDL since the beginning and was never asked. This decides what to
 * do with the answer, and every rule here exists to avoid crying wolf — a false "your codec is
 * broken" on an ordinary short call would be worse than the silence it replaces.
