/**
 * What the always-on [SetupJournal] may keep, and for how long.
 *
 * The debug log is off by default, so the first minutes after an install — the ones that fail on
 * phones we do not own — are recorded nowhere. Issue #23 is that exactly: a reporter stuck from the
 * first launch, asked for logs, and by then the moment was gone. This journal fills that gap, and
 * because nobody opted into it, the rules are deliberately narrow.
 *
 * **Setup and transport only.** Not calls, not audio, not transcripts, not numbers — a tag joins the
 * list below by being named, never by default.
 *
 * **Bounded, and it stops rather than rotates.** Keeping the FIRST run is the whole point; a rotation
 * would throw away the part that explains a phone that never worked in favour of the hundredth
 * healthy launch.
 *
 * **Finished once setup works.** The moment a recorder is connected, the journal has done its job and
 * writes nothing more, so a healthy phone never pays for it beyond the first success.

     * reboot or an update. `CV:DaemonKeepAlive` is deliberately absent — it re-warms on a timer, and
     * at a fixed cap its loop would crowd out the one run this file exists to hold.
