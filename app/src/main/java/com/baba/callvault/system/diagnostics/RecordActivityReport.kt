/**
 * Who is holding a microphone, according to Android rather than according to us.
 *
 * Parses the `RecordActivityMonitor` section of `dumpsys audio`, which logs a `rec start` / `update` /
 * `stop` per recording, each carrying a `riid`, the uid, the audio source and the package. An entry
 * with no matching `stop` *may* be a capture that was still open when the dump was taken.
 *
 * ## 🚨 What this section cannot tell you, and why
 *
 * **Some audio sources can never produce a `rec stop` at all**, so "no stop" is not evidence of
 * anything for them. The chain, from AOSP (`android16-release`):
 *
 * 1. `MediaRecorder.isSystemOnlyAudioSource()` treats `REMOTE_SUBMIX` as system-only — its case is
 *    deliberately commented out of the `return false` list.
 * 2. `RecordingActivityMonitor.onRecordingConfigurationChanged()` therefore logs the event and
 *    **returns early**, never calling `updateSnapshot()`. That riid's `mConfig` stays null for life.
 * 3. Client-side start/stop logging is gated on `configChanged`, which is `mConfig != null` — so it
 *    never logs.
 * 4. Server-side start/stop is separately suppressed for any client with a valid riid
 *    (`AudioInputDescriptor::updateClientRecordingConfiguration`).
 *
 * Only `rec update` survives. **A submix capture can therefore only ever appear as an unmatched
 * `update`. Always, on every healthy device.**
 *
 * This was verified the hard way: an earlier version of this file counted those entries as leaks and
 * reported **five "still open" captures on a phone with no symptom at all**, while every `MIC` and
 * `VOICE_CALL` capture in the same dump paired correctly and `dumpsys appops` showed the microphone
 * op closing cleanly. A whole investigation went the wrong way on it. Hence [MicOpReport], which reads
 * the app-op that actually drives the indicator.
 *
 * **Why this and not [com.baba.callvault.server.CaptureAudit].** That ledger lives inside whichever
 * process opened the capture, is only printed when something releases, and cannot see a capture held
 * by a process we no longer talk to — a leftover scrcpy server, a daemon from a previous app version,
 * or a Shizuku-hosted service. All of those present as uid 2000 / `com.android.shell`.
