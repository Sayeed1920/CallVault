/**
 * Room database hosting CallVault's recordings catalog. Single process. A plain
 * process-wide singleton ([get]) since there is no DI container in the app.
 *
 * The catalog is a derived, rebuildable cache (it can be re-seeded from the SAF folders), so schema
 * changes fall back to [RoomDatabase.Builder.fallbackToDestructiveMigration]: on a version bump the
 * table is recreated and the one-time import re-seeds it — no fragile hand-written migrations to
 * maintain.
 *
 * That fallback stays as the safety net, but a migration is written where dropping the table would
 * cost the user something real — and for `merge_parts` it would cost something unrecoverable, since
 * no folder walk can rediscover where one call ended and the next began. See [MIGRATION_2_3]. Re-seeding walks both SAF folders and then re-reads the length of
 * every recording, so a drop turns the first launch after an update into the slowest one — the exact
 * complaint [MIGRATION_1_2] exists to end.
