/**
 * What has to happen after the app is replaced — and the case that cost a real call.
 *
 * **The incident, 2026-09-06.** An update was installed at 11:35:05. Android stopped the app and its
 * foreground services (`FOREGROUND_SERVICE_STOP` in usage stats at exactly that second) and nothing
 * brought them back, because recovery was skipped whenever `WRITE_SECURE_SETTINGS` survived the update
 * — the reasoning being that there was nothing left to heal. But healing the grant was never the only
 * thing the app had to do: the update also **killed the privileged recorder**.
 *
 * At 11:42:59 a call came in. The app woke and started recording 14 s later, ran for eleven minutes and
 * wrote **nothing**, because there was no daemon to capture through. A 13-minute call was lost.
