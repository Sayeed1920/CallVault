/**
 * Reading the app-op that actually drives the microphone indicator.
 *
 * This exists because `dumpsys audio`'s record-activity log cannot answer the question — see
 * [RecordActivityReport]. `OP_RECORD_AUDIO` is what SystemUI watches, and `dumpsys appops` marks a
 * still-running one with `Running start at:`. Both fixtures are real output shapes taken from
 * devices, including one where the op was started deliberately to capture the running form.
