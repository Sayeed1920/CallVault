/**
 * What the always-on setup journal is allowed to keep.
 *
 * The journal exists because the debug log is off by default, so the very first setup — the one that
 * fails on phones we do not own — is never recorded. Issue #23 is exactly that: a reporter stuck from
 * the first minute, with nothing to send. Every rule here is a guard on a log that no one opted into,
 * so it stays narrow: setup and transport only, bounded, and finished for good once setup works.
