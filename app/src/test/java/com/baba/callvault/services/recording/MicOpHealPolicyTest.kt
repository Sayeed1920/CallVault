/**
 * When a stuck microphone indicator is healed by replacing the recorder daemon.
 *
 * A capture AudioFlinger invalidates mid-call leaves the shell uid's RECORD_AUDIO op running after the call,
 * and no stop or release on that track finishes it (rc14, tester's OnePlus 13, 2026-09-11). Replacing the daemon
 * process always does. Replacing it at the wrong moment costs a recording, so every rule here is about not doing
 * that.
