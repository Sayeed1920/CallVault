/**
 * Deciding whether a capture that was asked for ever actually began.
 *
 * This exists because of a hole issue #28's reporter fell into. `startRecording` returns void and
 * does its real work on a worker afterwards, so a codec that will not configure — he hit it by
 * switching to AAC — throws inside the daemon, is logged in a process with no log file, and leaves
 * the app believing it started. He got no recording, no error, and nothing in the report he sent.
 *
 * `isRecording()` has been in the AIDL the whole time and was never asked. The rules below are what
 * to do with the answer, and the subtleties are all about NOT crying wolf: a start that is merely
 * slow, or a daemon that has already gone, must not be reported as a codec failure.
